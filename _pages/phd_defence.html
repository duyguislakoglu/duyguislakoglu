	<h2><strong>[13:00] Guy Van den Broeck: Probabilistic and Logistic Circuits: A New Synthesis of Logic and Machine Learning <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/talks/KULeuven18.pdf">(slides)</a></strong></h2>

	<p>
		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
		This talk will discuss three lines of recent work at the intersection of logical reasoning and statistical machine learning.
		First, I describe tractable logical circuits and how they can be used to enforce constraints on the output of deep neural networks.
		Second, such circuits can be generalized to statistical classifiers, called logistic circuits, that achieve better classification accuracy on MNIST than neural networks that are an order of magnitude larger.
		Finally, I discuss how probabilistic circuits perform state-of-the-art probabilistic inference in factor graphs as well as imperative probabilistic programs.

	<h2><strong>[14:00] Mathias Niepert: Neural Representation Learning for Graphs</strong></h2>

	<p>
		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
		Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and occurs in numerous application domains.
		The talk will provide an overview of graph representation learning approaches such a graph convolutional networks.
		We show that these approaches can be understood from two different perspectives: as a special case of tensor factorizations and as instances of a class of algorithms that learn from local graph structures such as paths and neighborhoods.
		The talk will also discuss current work of our group including applications of graph neural networks.

	<h2><strong>[15:30] Sebastian Riedel: Reading and Reasoning with Neural Program Interpreters <a href="{{ "Symposium_SebastianRiedel.pdf" | prepend: '/assets/pdf/2018/' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">(slides)</a></strong></h2>


	<p>
	<strong>Abstract:</strong> We are getting better at teaching end-to-end neural models how to answer questions about content in natural language text. However, progress has been mostly restricted to extracting answers that are directly stated in the text. In this talk, I will present our work towards teaching machines not only to read but also to reason with what was read and to do this in an interpretable and controlled fashion. Our main hypothesis is that this can be achieved by the development of neural abstract machines that follow the blueprint of program interpreters for real-world programming languages. We test this idea using two languages: an imperative (Forth) and a declarative (Prolog/Datalog) one. In both cases, we implement differentiable interpreters that can be used for learning reasoning patterns. Crucially, because they are based on interpretable host languages, the interpreters also allow users to easily inject prior knowledge and inspect the learnt patterns. Moreover, on tasks such as math word problems and relational reasoning, our approach compares favourably to state-of-the-art methods.

		<strong>Abstract</strong><br/>
		The early 21<sup>st</sup> century has been largely shaped by the huge amounts of available data generated by the widespread adoption of information technology.
		This rapid growth of the stored data has created the need for automated tools capable of extracting useful bits from large amounts of data.
		In turn, such tools have changed our perspective on data from a mere record of an event to a carrier of useful information.
		Before insights can be drawn from the data, the data has to be first brought into a suitable form by means of <i>feature engineering</i> as it can rarely be processed in its <i>raw</i> form.
		This step is usually time- and labour-intensive, and often requires an extensive knowledge of the domain.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this thesis, we tackle the problem of <i>representation learning</i> -- how to automate the process of feature construction?
		We focus on feature construction with rich relational data expressed in form of networks, e.g., biological and traffic networks, as many real-life problems can be easily expressed in this format.
		To be able to express complex feature over networks, the proposed methods rely on the expressive data representation language of first-order logic.

	</p>

	<p>
		The first contribution of the thesis is a new versatile relational clustering framework that decouples various sources of relational similarity and combines them in a systematic manner.
		The second contribution is CUR<sup>2</sup>LED  -- a relational representation learning framework that exploits approximate symmetries in relational data as features.
		The third contribution are <i>Auto-encoding logic programs</i>  -- a relational generalisation of auto-encoders, one of the basic representation learning primitives.
		The fourth contribution is the experimental comparison of various relational representation learning methods that offers insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the existing approaches.
