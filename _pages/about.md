I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [DTAI lab](http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/){:target="\_blank"} at [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be){:target="\_blank"} working with [Hendrik Blockeel](http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~hendrik.blockeel/){:target="\_blank"} and [Luc De Raedt](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt){:target="\_blank"}.
My research is funded by the [FWO](https://www.fwo.be/){:target="\_blank"} postdoctoral fellowship.
I obtained my PhD from [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be){:target="\_blank"} in 2018 under the supervision of [Hendrik Blockeel](http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~hendrik.blockeel/){:target="\_blank"}.
Before that, I was a student at the [University of Zagreb](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/){:target="\_blank"}.


I design machines that learn and reason.
My goal is to develop machines that can learn as efficiently as humans, as well as apply their knowledge as flexibly.
In pursuing this goal, I contribute to and use techniques from [program induction/synthesis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/program-synthesis/){:target="\_blank"}, [inductive logic programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07912){:target="\_blank"}, [probabilistic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming){:target="\_blank"} and [statistical relational AI](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00692ED1V01Y201601AIM032){:target="\_blank"}.
My work is largely inspired by ideas and progress in [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science){:target="\_blank"}.
