I am a PostDoc in the [DTAI lab](http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/){:target="\_blank"} at [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be){:target="\_blank"} working with Professor [Hendrik Blockeel](http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~hendrik.blockeel/){:target="\_blank"}.
I obtained my PhD in 2018 in the same group.

My research focus is on machine learning models that learn useful abstractions of rich and complex relational data in a declarative manner by combining [statistical relational learning (SRL)](http://www.cs.umd.edu/srl-book){:target="\_blank"} and [deep learning](http://deeplearning.net/){:target="\_blank"}. SRL models are a powerful class of machine learning models that rely on expressive knowledge representation formats of logic and statistics to express a very wide range of machine learning models, not limited to vectors and matrices. That expressivity comes at high cost of learning and inference - reusable abstractions can help us tame this complexity!

In 2014, I have received my M.Sc. from the [University of Zagreb](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/){:target="\_blank"}.
I have spend the academic year of 2013-2014 as an Erasmus exchange student at [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be){:target="\_blank"}.
Between 2012 and 2013, I did interships at [Ericsson Nikola Tesla](http://www.ericsson.hr/homepage){:target="\_blank"} and [Department of Knowledge Technologies](http://kt.ijs.si/){:target="\_blank"} at the [Jožef Stefan Institute](https://www.ijs.si/ijsw){:target="\_blank"}.
